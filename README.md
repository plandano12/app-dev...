## SpiderMan 2
### OVERVIEW
**Two years after turning into Spider-Man, Peter Parker learns that his Aunt May is going to be evicted and finds himself cut off from both his romantic interest, Mary Jane Watson, and his best friend, Harry Osborn. He frequently finds himself in potentially fatal situations as he experiences fleeting but recurrent loses of power. 
**Nuclear scientist Otto Octavius is a friend and mentor of Peter, and he is working on a fusion power project that Harry, the head of Oscorp's genetic and scientific research section is funding. Octavius wears a harness of strong, artificially intelligent mechanical tentacles when handling dangerous materials. Peter and Harry attend Octavius and his wife Rosie's public harness demonstration the following day. Nevertheless, the fusion reactor destabilizes due to a power increase. When Octavius doesn't turn off the reactor, it goes critical, killing Rosie and destroying the inhibitor chip that keeps his nervous system's arms from opening. Peter shuts off the experiment as Spider-Man. Doctors at a hospital get ready to operate to take off Octavius' harness. Now that the inhibitor chip is gone, the tentacles are sentient.
### FEATURES 
*As Harry is ready to murder Spider-Man, he is startled to see Peter hiding behind the mask. For Mary Jane's sake, Peter persuades Harry to set aside their disagreement and leads him to Octavius' hideout. As the city begins to be threatened by a nuclear reaction, they fight once more. Peter comes clean and convinces Octavius to give up on his ambitions in the interest of the greater good. Octavius gives the tentacles orders to follow him and offers himself as a sacrifice to end the experiment. When Peter realizes Mary Jane who he really is, he claims that's why they can't be together.
